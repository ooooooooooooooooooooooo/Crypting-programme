# Crypting-programme
This is the Crypting programme, powered by C++

Project is multi-module. It consist of 3 modules. Each module is resopnsible for it's own aim.

First module is a headler.
Second is a main module.
Third is a module with description.

There are 3 easy steps to use that programme:
1. Enter your text that is needed to be encrypted/decrypted.
2. Choose mode: 1 - for encrypting, 2 - for decrypting.
3. Set the "key".

Something that you need to know about programme's work
- you can only enter a text that consists of upper latin letters ("ABCD...")
- symbols like ",", ".", "?", "!" are getting deleted
- space symbols are also become erased
- "key" has't to be above 0
- any symbol that is not a upper latin letter will excite a error message.
